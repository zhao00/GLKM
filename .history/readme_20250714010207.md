GKM is the core part of the paper.
FeiPub is based on the [FeiPub](https://github.com/ShenfeiPei/FeiPub), and LKM was written by [shenfeipei](https://github.com/ShenfeiPei) and is used for ownership.

### Description
This is the official code for the paper **"Efficient Greedy Optimization Method for k-means"**, published in *Pattern Recognition*, 2025.  
The core algorithm is implemented in C++ and provides a Python interface.

### Installation
```bash
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
```

### organization
+ GKM is the core part of the paper and implements the proposed greedy local k-means algorithm.

+ FeiPub is based on the [FeiPub repository](https://github.com/ShenfeiPei/FeiPub).

+ LKM was written by [shenfeipei](https://github.com/ShenfeiPei) to fune-tune the objective function.
