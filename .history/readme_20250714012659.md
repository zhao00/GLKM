### Description
This is the official code for the paper **"Efficient Greedy Optimization Method for k-means"**, published in *Pattern Recognition*, 2025.  
The core algorithm is implemented in C++ and provides a Python interface.

### Installation
```bash
cd GKM
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
cd ../LKM
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
```

### requirements
```bash
cython
```

### Usage
see demo.py


+ **GKM** is the core part of the paper and implements the proposed greedy local k-means algorithm.

+ FeiPub is based on the [FeiPub repository](https://github.com/ShenfeiPei/FeiPub).

+ LKM was written by [shenfeipei](https://github.com/ShenfeiPei) to fune-tune the objective function.
